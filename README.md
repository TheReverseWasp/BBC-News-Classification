# BBC-News-Classification using Unsupervised Learning

This repository implements a baseline solution for this [Kaggle Contest](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learn-ai-bbc/overview). 

## Architecture

This solution was made using a i5 generation 11 with 12 cores.

## Conclusions

In this work, I implemented a baseline unsupervised learning approach using an SVD for the BBC news classification Kaggle contest. The overall score of this solution is 0.16054. The points the code could be improved are attached in the notebook conclussion and summarised are the improvements in preprocessing, using other unsupervised solutions, and the test of deep learning approach.
